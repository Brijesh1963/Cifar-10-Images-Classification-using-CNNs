Cifar-10 Images Classification using CNNs

The images are very small (32x32) and by visualizing them you will notice how difficult it is to distinguish them even for a human.

In this notebook we are going to build a CNN model that can classify images of various objects. We have 10 class of images:

Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck
